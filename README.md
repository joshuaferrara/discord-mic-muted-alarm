# Mic Muted Alarm

BetterDiscord plugin that plays an audio notification when you're mic has been muted for a custom amount of time. By default, the plugin will play an elevator bell ding sound 30s after you've muted your mic, provided you aren't deafened.

The plugin has various options that can be configured from the settings menu found in your BetterDiscord "Plugins" list.

## Customization
* Time before alert plays
* Whether or not to alert while you're deafened
* Alert volume
* Alert sound (URL or base64-encoded audio file)
